This app was a one time addition to an escape room I made. It features several fun mini puzzles that allowed me to play around and mimic other things I saw. Some of these include a puzzle based on items in the escape room, an Organ Trail minigame, a login puzzle, and an RPG battle system similar to pokemon.

This was made using Kotlin in Android Studio and is considered complete. I will not be updating this further as I mentioned it was only something for the one time challenge.
